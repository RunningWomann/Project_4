## Background
In a post-COVID era, the aviation industry experienced a shortage of airline workers, and struggled to meet the high demand. Travelers in 2022 were most likely to experience flight delays and cancellations.  

Using data from U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), we gathered and analyzed 5 years worth of data from 04/2018 to 04/2023 to track the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by 10 large air carriers.  

## Key Things to Note
What is considered “delayed”?
A flight is considered delayed when it arrived 15 or more minutes later than the schedule

How many years are we analyzing?
We are analyzing 5 years worth of historical data. We will be reviewing data from April 2018 to April 2023.
